		<h3><em>Ways of Seeing and Understanding a Photograph</em></h3>

		<p>What stood out to me in John Berger‚Äôs Ways of Seeing, was Berger discussing the relationship between paintings and the reproduction of paintings. He also goes to point out what techniques within reproduction does to the meaning behind the painting as well as the painting itself. One of the techniques that Berger talks about was the addition of music. In his example with the Caravaggio painting, he inserts two pieces of music, one at a reasonably fast pace and another at a slow pace using a choir. Having those music pieces playing in the background at different time changes the significance of the painting. It goes against the artist‚Äôs original intention and feeling and therefore, turns into a reproduction. Also, the fact that with the use of the camera, a different ‚Äúset of eyes‚Äù, has the ability to change the meaning of a painting too. If the camera focuses on a certain aspect, like the background, foreground etc., it changes the meaning to a landscape or the subjects within the painting, so on and so forth.

		John Berger‚Äôs essay, Understanding a Photograph, talks about the relationship between photography and fine art. There was a point in the essay where he talks about how ‚Äúphotographs bear witness to a human choice being exercised in a given situation‚Äù and the idea of composition and arrangement. In a painting, especially during the Renaissance times, there was a sense of composition. Where the subjects were, in contrast to the background, are areas related to the composition that the artist had in mind. In a photograph, composition and arrangement is dealt by the photographer themselves. It all falls on the photographer‚Äôs choice at the moment. Photography and paintings both belong in this fine art category because of the choices they make behind the work of art they have made. Where painting takes time, photography is more in the moment.

		<h3><em>As We May Think and Long Live the Web</em></h3>

		<p>
		Tim Berners Lee‚Äôs Long Live the Web, not only gives a guide of different principles of the web in great detail, but goes on to tell the readers that it is important to conserve the web as developers, companies, citizens etc and keep these principles alive. Not carelessly leave it in the hands of ill-minded corporations and/or governments who threaten electronic human rights. What stood out to me was the concept of universality. The fact that no matter the hardware, software, network connection etc., the Web will still be able to function under the Internet. However, the fact that companies or governments can mess with the Internet and limit these functions are all the more important reason to protect these rights and let users experience the limitless aspects of the Web. I do not understand Vannevar Bush‚Äôs As We May Think. I believe it applies this kind of universality with science in general. The fact that everyone, whether it would be companies, governments, citizens, scientists etc., has the ability to use their creativity with science and protect those who want to crush that creativity. I‚Äôm honestly not sure.
